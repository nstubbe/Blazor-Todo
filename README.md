# Blazor-Todo
With all the buzz around Blazor, I decided to make a small todo application using the technology.

The project contains a front-end application using Blazor, which communicates with a Web API. This API stores the todos in an Sqlite database through EF Core.

# Summary
I liked working in Blazor, although it did feel a bit 'slow' at times. I'm not talking about execution times, but about development speed. Having to restart the entire project to see a few changes in your front-end code when you're used to your application rebuilding on the fly with Angular / Vue.js isn't the best experience. Besides that I have no major issues, and I'm really looking forwards to using this tech more in the future.
