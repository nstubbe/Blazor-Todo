# Blazor todo
With all the buzz surrounding Blazor, I decided to make a small todo application using the technology.

The project contains a front-end application using Blazor, which communicates with a Web API. This API stores the todos in an Sqlite database through EF Core.

# Summary
I liked working in Blazor, although it did feel a bit 'slow' at times. I'm not talking about execution times, but about development speed. Having to restart the entire project to see a few changes in your front-end code when you're used to your application rebuilding on the fly with Angular / Vue.js isn't the best experience. Besides that I have no major issues, and I'm really looking forward to using this tech more in the future.

# How to run
Follow the **Get Started** guide for Blazor (found on [Blazor.net](https://www.blazor.net)) until you're able to create your own Blazor project. Now just clone and run.
